**EEPROM editor and simulator for opentx, gruvin9x, er9x, partially th9x and hopefully RadioClone opensource firmwares for the 9X transmitter and FrSky Taranis Radio**

Initially based on the eePe project, has evolved to offer a fully featured radio simulator, and complete support to the OpenTX firmware. It also offers a nice conversion system between EEPROM formats which are specific to each firmware. We have begun to work on an export feature to a unified XML format which will be understandable by humans.
